## Where is my store?

---

1. Refactor this Robots App from using a local component state to a globalapplication state with Redux
2. Create all of the necessary files and folders
3. install all of the needed npm packages
4. Use the previous Redux demos as a reference to implement the following steps:
5. Create a `root.reducer.js` and decide how your state will look like mapping any other reducer when needed.
6. Create the store
7. Wrap the app with a `<Provider>` to make the store accessible to the app
8. Connect to the redux store from the react components using react-redux hooks. ( useSelector & useDispatch )
9. Decide on the neceray actions, when and how to dispatch them.
10. Do not rest until you finish this challenge!
